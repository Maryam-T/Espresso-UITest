# EspressoUITest
Espresso is a testing framework for Android to make it easy to write reliable user interface tests. In this project just switch between 
branches for testing different components such as fragment, recycler view, intents, dialog and etc.

Just consider 2 points. Firstly, make sure your device is unlocked while your tests run. Secondly, turn off the animation on your device
which is used for testing. Animations might be confusingÂ Espressos check for idling resources.

Enjoy the code and your pull requests are most welcome :)
